= How to list a token
:toc:

== Introduction

This document describes the process how to submit a request for adding a new Altcoin or token (we use the general term token in that document) to the currency list in Bisq. Adding a token does not mean any endorsement of the token. For making decisions in case of controversial requests we use the Bisq DAO voting process. The maintainers of the GH repository have the authority to merge or reject the PR based on the formal requirements but not on "political" objections (e.g. consider the token as scam-coin,...).

Please note that Bisq is not implementing technically any token infrastructure (wallet, full nodes, block explorer,...) but only supports that the users can add the token address to a payment account and then during the trade process the users exchange the token address. The process of sending and receiving the token is not part of the Bisq application (traders use their own token wallets).

Already added token which have been traded at least once or which have provided a PR for the address validation will be kept. All other tokens will be removed with the 0.6 release.

This document replaces the process described in the link:https://forum.bisq.io/t/how-to-add-your-favorite-Altcoin/46[Bisq forum].


== Prerequisites

=== Block explorer

There need to be an active block explorer available.

=== The ticker symbol does not conflict with national currency tickers

The ticker symbol must not conflict with one of the national currency ISO 4217 ticker symbols listed at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217

=== The ticker symbol does not conflict with other crypto-currency tickers

The ticker symbol must not conflict with one of the top 100 crypto-currency ticker symbols listed at: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies  at the time when the PR gets created

=== The token does not need extra requirements

Be sure that the requirements to add the token does not cause extra effort for Bisq like adding additional input fields (e.g. if the address alone is not sufficient for the trade).

=== Arbitrator need to be able to see the transaction in the block explorer

The arbitrator need to be able to see the transaction in the block explorer by using the receiver address. In case that is not possible as a result of enhanced privacy features (Zcash, Monero, CryptoNote coins,...) a suggested solution need to be added to the PR (e.g. in Zcash we support only transparent addresses not z-addresses; in Monero we require that the user is using a Monero wallet which supports transaction keys to enable 3rd party audits of the transaction which is used in case of a dispute). As such additional cased require additional effort (popup with background info) it will be up to Bisq contributors to add a PR for the popup and translation strings. Of course the code or the popup can be part of the PR as well but a more detailed description is out of scope of that document.


== Instructions

=== Step 1. Add address validation code:

Add code for address validation to method `validate` in class `io.bisq.gui.util.validationAltCoinAddressValidator`.

=== Step 2. Add unit test for address validation:

Add unit tests with different addresses of the token to class `io.bisq.gui.util.AltCoinAddressValidatorTest` and be sure the tests don't fail.

=== Step 3. Add entry to currency list:

Add entry for the token to method `createAllSortedCryptoCurrenciesList` in class `io.bisq.common.locale.CurrencyUtil`.
First parameter is ticker, second parameter token name and the optional third parameter is the boolean `isAsset` parameter. Set that to true in case the token is not using a dedicated blockchain but is issued on other blockchains (e.g. colored coins, ETH tokens,...). The list is ordered alphabetic by token name. Add your entry at the correct position.

Examples:

----
// token with dedicated blockchain
result.add(new CryptoCurrency("XMR", "Monero"));

// token issued on another blockchain
result.add(new CryptoCurrency("MT", "Mycelium Token", true));
----

=== Step 4. Fill out form

Copy the below form template, paste it into the PR (next step) and fill out the form.

----
- Ticker symbol (e.g. LTC): ...
- Official token name (e.g. Litecoin): ...
- Official block explorer URL: ...
- Is it an Altcoin (dedicated blockchain) or a token (anything else) (e.g. Altcoin): ...
- Official token project URL: ...
----

=== Step 5. Make a pull request

Make a pull request in GitHub to the Bisq `Development` branch.


== Caveats

=== Controversial tokens may be put to a vote

 - Any BSQ token holder can request that a decision for adding the token should be decided in the Bisq DAO voting process (the Bisq DAO will be executed in a manual manner as long the full DAO version is not implemented according to the DAO phase 0 doc https://github.com/sqrrm/docs/tree/master/dao/phase-zero
 - If such a request for voting is filed the PR will be delayed until the next voting period. Filing a request for voting is described in the DAO voting document (TODO: add link, not available atm, see https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals for now).
 - If the voting has > 50% of votes and reaches the required quorum (at least 5% of total BSQ stake need to vote on it) the result will be used to accept or reject the token. Not reaching the quorum results in a rejection.
 - For requesting again a token which got rejected by voting it requires a clear statement about the changed circumstances. Objecting the political positions is not sufficient (e.g. Coin XXX is not a scamcoin because of ....).
 - Any BSQ token holder can also request a voting to remove an already supported token.

=== Inactive tokens will be de-listed

 - At each new release we will check if already added tokens have been traded in the past 4 months. If this requirement is not met the token will be removed. The Bisq trade statistics are taken as reference. Removal of a not-traded token will not be announced beside in the release notes of the new release.
 - Adding the token again requires a statement about the changed circumstances (e.g. link to discussions where demand for the token is documented,...).

=== Getting an added token into production might take a bit

Adding a new token will be part of the normal release cycle.
